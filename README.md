## Analysis of the Citibikes data in New York city using Excell
- Set up a spreadsheet on google sheets, where I imported NY citi bike data for the past year,
- Was given a task to find the answers to 5 questions:
..What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for Bike rental?
..How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
..Which age group rents the most bikes?
..How does bike rentalvary across the two user groups (ont-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
..Does user age impact the average impact the average bike trip duration?
- I then cleaned my data by removing duplicates and missing data points by creating a filter,
- Found the mean, median and range for the trip duration and the age of the riders,
- The range for the amount of time spent on the bike indicated an outlier, whose row of data was deleted,
- 4 pivot tables were created,
- Then I created a bar chart for the top 20 NY Citi bike pick-up locations,
- I created a column chart showing the average trip duration across different age groups,
- I created another bar chart for the number of bike rentals per age group,
- I also produced a stacked stepped area chart for weekday and user type (being one-time users or a subscriber),
- The final graph I created was a scatter plot which plottd the age of the riders and the length of the trip
